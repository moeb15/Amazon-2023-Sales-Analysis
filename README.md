# Amazon-2023-Sales-Analysis
The goal of this project is to provide a descriptive analysis of Amazon sales data in 2023 thus far.  
In the EDA notebook you will find me go through the process of cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data.  
I later provide some descriptive statistics of the data, take a look at how the variates are distributed,  
and assess any correlations between the data points.
